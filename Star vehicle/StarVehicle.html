                        <p>Hi, a best option to enjoy holidays at outstation. Hired a star Vehicle on self-drive basis at Indore. Could save time and money. The blocked amount was refunded within 4 days. Thanking for a good service. I would say, it is a good option for non-freak drivers.</p>

                        <p>Definitely a boon for people like me who can’t afford to own a car. It also will take you off the hassle of parking a car and definitely a plus for city like Indore which is heavily saturated with private vehicles on road and off road. A service like this should be promoted by government. It is definitely a plus over hiring a cab and losing your privacy.....thumbs up to Star Vehicle.</p>
